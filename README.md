# API-Server

An Express/Node.js based server designed to be a “model agnostic” REST API server, which can perform CRUD operations on any data model

## Journal:

Day1: Setup application with json-server, some data and making sure postman is recognizing and able to execute CRUDE operations.

Day2: Setup express server and middleware, and tests for them.

Day3: Setup Mongoose DB instead of in-memory database for persistance. Create schemas, models and collections.

Day4: Modularize the application even further, done by making one main route handler with a get :model param. As well as extend one Collection file to both models
